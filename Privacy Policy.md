# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** October 17, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how this application (‚Äúthe App‚Äù) handles information when you use Google authentication or connect Google services (such as Google Drive, Gmail, or Sheets).

## 1. Information We Collect

When you connect your Google account, the App may access limited data through Google APIs, such as:

- Your basic Google profile information (name, email address)
- Files, emails, or data required for the app‚Äôs intended functionality

We only request the minimum scopes necessary to perform actions you explicitly initiate.  
The App does **not** collect, store, or share personal information beyond what is required to deliver its features.

---

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Your information is used exclusively to perform the actions you request ‚Äî for example:

- Reading or writing data to your Google Drive  
- Sending emails or managing documents through authorized Google APIs  

Data is processed in real time and **not permanently stored** on our servers unless necessary for an ongoing task (e.g., an automation running inside your account or system).

---

## 3. Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.  
Information may only be disclosed:

- When required by law, or  
- When necessary to fulfill the purpose of your explicit request (e.g., sending data to a Google API endpoint).

---

## 4. Security

We use industry-standard security measures, including encrypted HTTPS connections and OAuth 2.0 authentication.  

Access tokens are stored securely within your connected automation environment (e.g., n8n instance) and are never exposed publicly or shared externally.

---

## 5. User Control and Revocation

You remain in control of your Google data at all times.  
You can revoke access granted to the App by visiting your Google Account settings:

üëâ [https://myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)

Once revoked, the App can no longer access your Google data unless you explicitly re-authorize it.
